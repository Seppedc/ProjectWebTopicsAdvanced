here u can execute the following command to start the vue project:

Experimenting with the site: 
Rignt now when u load up the site u can navigate to the diffrent pages. 
As soon as u navigate to the Gamestart page the game will be loaded in and u can play the game.
If the player gains enough points to be on the leaderboard a popup will be shown when the game is over.
The user can insert their name.
The data will be saved  using the api but when u try and use the site again everything breaks.
When u reload the site u can use it again. and u will be able to see that the highscores have been updated.
